- Change the Probability Transition Function on TERMINAL states to have uniform distribution to all NON-TERMINAL states for ALL actions.

- Choose any arbitrary policy and find its value function using direct method.

- Create a sufficiently long trajectory (x_0; r_1; x_1; r_2; x_2; .....) using that policy.

- Run `Temporal difference learning` on that trajectory (Temporal difference using step-sizes).

- Compare the results
