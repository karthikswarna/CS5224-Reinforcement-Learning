### Task 1 (Modify the tictactoe such that the opponent (who plays 'O') is automated using a probability transition function.)
-----------
1) Model the state space and action space.
2) Create an arbitrary probability transition function.
3) Make use of the above probability transition function to decide the move of the opponent.

In this part your move will be performed by yourself using the mouse itself. Only the opponent move is automated.


### Task 2
-----------
1) Create an arbitrary policy.
2) Make changes to the code to follow that policy (This means the mouse click is no more required. The code will follow the policy to find your move.)
